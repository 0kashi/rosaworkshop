## About the deployment section in this Workshop.

So, you've probably noticed there are quite a few pages in this "Deploy the cluster" section and you may be wondering "Which one do I do?" or "Just tell me how to get my cluster deployed for this workshop!".  Use this simple decision tree.

If you are thinking:

- "Just tell me the commands I need to run!" - [Simple CLI guide](17-simple_cli_deploy.md).
- "I don't like CLI's. Give me a user interface!" - [Simple UI guide](19-simple-ui-deploy.md).
- "I need details!" - [Detailed CLI guide](2-deploy.md) or [Detailed UI guide](16-deploy_ui.md).
<!--- "I want to experiment with the new stuff." - [ROSA w/HCP](18-deploy_hcp.md).-->

Any of the above will work for this workshop; so just pick one.  If you are doing this workshop for the first time we'd recommend using the [Simple CLI guide](17-simple_cli_deploy.md).
