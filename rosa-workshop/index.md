<!---## Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) information pages-->

### What is Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA)?
ROSA is a _fully_ managed Red Hat OpenShift service running natively on Amazon Web Services (AWS), which allows customers to quickly and easily build, deploy, and manage Kubernetes applications on the industryâ€™s most comprehensive Kubernetes platform in the AWS public cloud. 

### What information is on this site?
These pages are split into two sections. One contains the steps to getting started on ROSA ("Getting started with ROSA").  While the other is about deploying an application to ROSA to get better familiar with the internals of OpenShift ("OpenShift Internals Lab") and deploy your first application on ROSA.

### Creating your first ROSA Cluster
If you'd like an easy to follow guide for creating your first ROSA cluster you've come to the right place.

1. First please review the [prerequisites](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_getting_started/rosa-aws-prereqs.html) which contains important information about the AWS account requirements.  
1. Then visit the Getting Started tutorial for [Setting up your account](rosa/1-account_setup.md).
